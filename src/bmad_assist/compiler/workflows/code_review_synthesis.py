"""Compiler for the code-review-synthesis workflow.

This module implements the WorkflowCompiler protocol for the synthesis workflow,
producing standalone prompts for Master LLM to synthesize code review findings
and apply source code fixes.

Context includes strategic docs based on config (default: project-context only).
Synthesis workflows need minimal strategic context as they aggregate reviewer outputs.

The synthesis context includes:
- Strategic docs via StrategicContextService (default: project-context only)
- Anonymized code review outputs (Reviewer A, B, C, D)
- Git diff (what was implemented)
- Modified source files (what to fix)
- Story file (what was requested - positioned LAST for recency-bias)

This focused context allows Master to evaluate reviewer findings with
access to project rules, implementation changes, and source code that needs fixing.

2. PRIORITIZE real issues by severity
   - Critical: Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks
   - High: Bugs, logic errors, missing error handling
   - Medium: Code quality issues, performance concerns
   - Low: Style issues, minor improvements

3. SYNTHESIZE findings
   - Merge duplicate issues from different reviewers
   - Note reviewer consensus (if 3+ agree, high confidence)
   - Highlight unique insights from individual reviewers

4. APPLY source code fixes
   - You have WRITE PERMISSION to modify SOURCE CODE files
   - CRITICAL: Before using Edit tool, ALWAYS Read the target file first
   - Use EXACT content from Read tool output as old_string, NOT content from this prompt
   - If Read output is truncated, use offset/limit parameters to locate the target section
   - Apply fixes for verified issues
   - Do NOT modify the story file (only Dev Agent Record if needed)
   - Document what you changed and why

## Issues Verified (by severity)
## Issues Dismissed (false positives with reasoning)
## Source Code Fixes Applied"""
